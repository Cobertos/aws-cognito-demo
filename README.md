Amazon Cognito is a service that makes it easy to save user data in the AWS Cloud without writing any backend code or managing any infrastructure.
With Amazon Cognito, you can focus on creating great app experiences instead of having to worry about building and managing a backend solution to handle user authentication, network state, storage, and sync.
